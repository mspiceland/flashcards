# Summary

This was a quick experiment using the Web Speech API --
webkitSpeechRecognition() to build flashcards for my kids.  My kids lost
interest in previous flashcard apps we made for them because of how disruptive
it was to to type in the answer.  Using this method, they are able to provide
the answers without loosin their train of thought.

## notes

* this was just a weekend morning hack
* sometimes it get stuck waiting input need to play with continuous = false
* dealing with errors isn't rebust
